### Convenience functions for simple Google Calendar usage for NodeJS

Based on [google-calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanasit/google-calendar)

To install:

```
npm install google-calendar-helpers
```

### Usage

Initialize API:

```
var accessToken = '--- your access token ---'
  , clientId = '--- client ID ---'
  , clientSecret = '--- client secret ---'
  , calendarId = '--- Google Calendar Id ---'
  , CalendarClient = require('google-calendar-helpers');
  , calendarClient = new CalendarClient(accessToken, clientId, clientSecret, calendarId);
```

Access tokens and stuff explained [here](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) and
a node module for obtaining access token and refresh token [here](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth).

#### Methods

__calendarClient.getEvents(timeMin, timeMax, callback)__

Returns a list of events from `timeMin` to `timeMax` (RFC 3339 formatted strings)

NB: Makes multiple requests when necessary (if there are more than one page of events)

__calendarClient.getPastEvents(options, callback)__
__calendarClient.getFutureEvents(options, callback)__

Returns a list of past or future events, respectively.

Options object (optional) can have property 'dayRange' specifying how many days into
the past or future to extend the query. Defaults to 30.

__calendarClient.submitNewEvent(event, callback)__

Adds new event to calendar. `event` must be a Google
[event resource object](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/events#resource)

Callback is called with `error` and `event` which is the newly created event.

__calendarClient.submitModifiedEvent(event, callback)__

Updates an event. `event` must be an event resource object with property `id` of an existing event.

Callback is called with `error` and `event` which is the modified event as returned by Google.

__calendarClient.deleteEvent(eventId, callback)__

Deletes an event. Argument `eventId` (string) is the id of an existing event.

Callback is called with `error` as only argument.

### Testing

Run `grunt jasmine_node` to test. Add your access tokens etc. in `test/config.json` for the tests to work.
_NB! Tests erase existing event in the calendar, so create a specific test calendar for testing!_
